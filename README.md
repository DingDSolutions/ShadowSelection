ShadowSelection
===============
A basic Greasemonkey script to change the default selection colour of the Browser.
It removes the background colour form the selection text and adds Text Shadow property to highlight the selected words.
Planning to add user options allowing the users to edit the Text Color and Shadow's angle, depth and color before 
publishing in Userscript hosting websites.
