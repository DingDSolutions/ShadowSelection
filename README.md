ShadowSelection
===============
This is a simple userscript to change the default selection style of your Browser.
It removes the background colour form the selection text and adds Text Shadow property to the selected words.
Planning to add Preferences UI to allow the users to edit the Text Color and Shadow's angle, depth and color soon.

To add this change to your browser [Install the script from here](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/anveshak/Shadow_Selection).

Presently the selection color is in Blue by default. You can edit the color and shadow properties, directly in the
script. Works well with Firefox and Chrome. Use [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) in Firefox and [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) in Chrome to install the Userscript.
